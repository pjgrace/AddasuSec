# AddasuSec 🔐

**An adaptive component framework for secure, model-driven runtime architecture.**

AddasuSec enables dynamic management of software components using trust boundaries, access control models, and runtime architectural introspection. It's designed for systems that need to adapt and secure themselves during execution based on runtime threat modeling and metadata inspection.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Component Lifecycle Management** – Create, delete, connect, and disconnect components dynamically.
- **Meta-Model Support** – Architecture, access control, and dataflow meta-models to manage runtime behavior.
- **Interface-Level Control** – Inspect and modify interface metadata; track receptacles and connections.
- **Security & Adaptability** – Adapt trust boundaries and component logic based on runtime states.

## 🧪 Usage Example

Here’s a sample script that mirrors `tests/main.py`. It shows how to instantiate, connect, use, tag, and remove components at runtime.

```python
from AddasuSec.Receptacle import Receptacle
from Runtimes.runtime import runtime
from MetaArchitecture.MetaArchitecture import MetaArchitecture

# Setup runtime and meta-model
meta = MetaArchitecture()
runtime_env = runtime(meta)

# Create components
calc1 = runtime_env.create("plain", "Examples.Calculator", "Calculator1", False)
adder = runtime_env.create("plain", "Examples.Adder", "Adder1", False)

# Connect interface
runtime_env.connect("plain", calc1, adder, "Examples.IAdd")

# Perform operation
result = calc1.add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {result}")

# Set and get metadata
meta.setInterfaceAttributeValue("Calculator1", "Examples.IAdd", "Version", 1.0)
assert meta.getInterfaceAttributeValue("Calculator1", "Examples.IAdd", "Version") == 1.0

# Cleanup
runtime_env.disconnect("plain", calc1, adder, "Examples.IAdd")
runtime_env.delete("plain", "Calculator1")
```

## 📚 Developer Guide

To help you build and extend AddasuSec-based systems, we provide a growing set of hands-on tutorials and articles:

- [🧩 Writing Your First Component](./devguide/WritingComponentsGuide.md) – Create secure, type-safe components within a local address space using interfaces and receptacles.
- [🌐 Writing Web-Based Components](./devguide/WritingWebComponentsGuide.md) – Build and connect and adapt components across distributed address spaces. The tutorial shows how
to run components in different locations, and then adapt them from a central adaptor.
- [🔐 Adding Authentication & Access Control](./devguide/AuthenticationAndAccessControlGuide.md) – Integrate security models into your architecture and enforce runtime access policies.

These guides will help you structure, test, and adapt components in real-world systems.
