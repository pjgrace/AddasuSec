# AddasuSec
An adaptive software component framework in Python. Local and remote components can be seamlessly adapted in order to change the trust boundary of the system. Multiple meta models (architecture, access control, data flow) allow the components to be inspected and adapted at runtime. For example, threat modelling based on the runtime models.
